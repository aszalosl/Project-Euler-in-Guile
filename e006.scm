;; Problem #6
;; The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is, 
;; 1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
;; The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
;; (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025
;; Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten 
;; natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
;; Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first 
;; one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
