;; Problem #21
; Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n 
; (numbers less than n which divide evenly into n).
; If d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a â‰  b, then a and b are an amicable pair 
; and each of a and b are called amicable numbers.
; For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 
; 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110; therefore d(220) = 284. 
; The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142; so d(284) = 220.
; Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10000.
